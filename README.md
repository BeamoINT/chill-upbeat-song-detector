This is a small AI model that detects the differences between chill and upbeat songs using a scale of 1-5 with 1 meaning chill and 5 meaning upbeat. It's pretty simple and that's it.

In order to test out the AI model, replace test.mp3 with the music mp3 file that you want to try it out on, or just use the default one that is inside of the repository already and see what score it returns. Just run the command `python3 run.py` or `python run.py` depending on what version of Python you have installed on your machine that you are running this on.
