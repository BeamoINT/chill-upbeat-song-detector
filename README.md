This is a small AI model that detects the differences between chill and upbeat songs using a scale of 1-5 with 1 meaning chill and 5 meaning upbeat. It's pretty simple and that's it.

There is currently just a training script in this codebase, but there will be more soon, including a weights file and an easy inference script that can be run in order to actually run inference on the model easily.
